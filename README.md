# Physiotherapy_Pose_Detection_System
This project aims to assist physiotherapy patients in performing exercises correctly using deep learningbased pose detection. The system captures a patients body posture through a webcam, detects key body points using the MediaPipe pose estimation model, and compares them with the correct physiotherapy poses. It then provides realtime feedback .
